          MultiCards are card components that use subcards to display extra information, add user interactivity, 
          and create unique card layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept for MultiCard originally stemmed from the idea of making a digital business card. 
          The vision for this original concept can be exemplified in the MultiCard below. <br>
        </p> 
        <p>Click on subheaders of the card to see what MultiCards can do.</p>

          Realzing there are more than just one use case, this idea was extrapolated to apply this functionality in different contexts.

          Of course, sliding subcards can occur for different types of events aside from clicks. Here's an example of a possible
          onHover card that can be used for minimalist image galleries.

          You can even create subcards that are larger than the dimensions of their parents. This will automatically make the subcard fade in and out
          when sliding.<br>
          <br> Here's MultiCard's functionality applied to an example Trivia Card. <br>(See if you can get the answer without revealing it).

          Now, you might be thinking, 'I get it, it's just a card component with drawers'. However, these examples
          only scratch the surface in terms of the creative layouts you can use these components in.

          MultiCards use a linked structure where each MultiCard points to a subcard in each of its four directions: up, down, left, and right. 
          But, each subcard is also a MultiCard! This means each subcard is capable of creating their own subcards.
