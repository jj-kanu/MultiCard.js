          Inspired by the idea of a digital business card, MultiCard allows developers to display clean and minimalist cards, while also 
          giving options to the user to display more information.

          Of course, sliding subcards can occur for different types of events aside from clicks. Here's an example of a possible
          onHover card that can be used for minimalist image galleries.

          Different types of templates are planned for Multicards. As of right now, cards can have header titles if wanted. <br>

          Now, you might be thinking, 'I get it, it's just a card component with drawers'. However, these examples
          only scratch the surface in terms of the creative layouts you can use these components in.

          MultiCards use a linked structure where each MultiCard points to a subcard in each of its four directions: up, down, left, and right. 
          But, each subcard is also a MultiCard! That means they can have their own subcards. Try the example below to see this visualized.
