          MultiCards are card components that use subcards to add extra information, user interactivity, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea for MultiCard originally stemmed from the idea of making a digital business card. 
          This use of MultiCard demonstrates an example of its original purpose. <br>
        </p> 
        <p>Click on sections of the card to view its functionality.</p>

        <p>
          Of course, sliding subcards can occur for different types of events aside from clicks. Here's an example of a possible
          onHover card that can be used for minimalist image galleries.

          Different types of templates are planned for Multicards. As of right now, cards can have header titles if wanted. <br>
           Here is an example of a MultiCard with header used to make trivia cards that display hints and answers.

          Now, you might be thinking, 'I get it, it's just a card component with drawers'. However, these examples
          only scratch the surface in terms of the creative layouts you can use these components in.
        </p>
        <p>
          MultiCards use a linked structure where each MultiCard points to a subcard in each of its four directions: up, down, left, and right. 
          But, each subcard is also a MultiCard! That means they can have their own subcards.
