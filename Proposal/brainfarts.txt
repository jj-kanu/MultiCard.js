Stuff that I like:
- Attack On Titan / Anime
- Video Games
- Track

Possible Ideas
- Sticky Notes: Basically, in the shape and colour that I have in my room. 
	(Most note taking apps just have the simple sticky, I want different lenghts)
	(The tags can act as anchors.)
- Interactive Images
- More general version of above would be modals shaped like a circle and a plus. When you hover the plus either keeps spinning or spins by 90 degrees every s.
- Page flip animation for browsing?
- Label divs and stuff to make designing easier. ie have divs bordered etc.
- Set up mis-en-plait for recipes
